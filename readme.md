# git-rgen-tool

Tool to programmatically generate git repositories from structured assets.

## Example

The [gl-exA](https://github.com/mj41/gl-exA) repository (including the history) was generated by

```
cd git-rgen-tool
go run ./cmd/rgen --conf ../gl-exA-src/rgen-conf.json
cd ../gl-exA
git log --oneline --decorate --graph
```
based on [gl-exA-src](https://github.com/mj41/gl-exA-src) assets.

## Specification

See [docs/rgen-spec.md](docs/rgen-spec.md) for the specification of the assets structure and how git-rgen works.
